# Gorp - Simple Minecraft CLI Tools
This is the alpha rewrite of Gorp. Please don't use on production systems.

## Why?
Shell scripts are nice, yes, but after a bit of development (if you can call it that), they become unweildy. I was always planning on taking this step. I'm not entirely familiar with Python, so having an algorithm or series of steps to follow from the BASH version will help me greatly.

## Why Python?
Because it can do pretty much anything and has a really nice subprocess handler for the 1 or 2 BASH scripts that will remain.

## When?
Idk, hopefully sometime soon.
